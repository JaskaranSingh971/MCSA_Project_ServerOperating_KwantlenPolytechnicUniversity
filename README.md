OVERVIEW

This topic will involve analysis of a business case and the design of a network to support it. The precise details of
the business case are below. For the project you will be required to:
a. Create an organization chart for the business.
b. Provide cost data for the system’s hardware, software and licenses, including references for your prices.
c. Design and document the organizational units, security groups, and shared folder configuration that you
will need.
d. Configure Windows Server 2016 for the business, including DNS, folder/file sharing and printer sharing. e.
Implement the OU and security group plan.
f. Add a folder redirection GPO.
g. Create an IT Department web page for the business, and deploy it using IIS server.
h. Submit a report including screenshots verifying every aspect of the implementation. You should also
describe what work would be needed from this point to actually implement your system in real life.

BUSINESS CASE

Sheev Palpatine and Mace Windu have decided to step back from their operations with the Jedi Council and have
chosen to open a new venture in Metro Vancouver, called “The Saber Shop”. Saber Shop sells lightsaber supplies
and accessories, services lightsabers, and runs training classes for customers. They have a single location in
Vancouver, but they have plans to expand eventually to Richmond, Surrey, and Abbotsford.
Saber Shop has three main departments as described above: sales, service, and training. Each department has a
manager as well as staff, and there is a general manager over the Vancouver location as well. There are six sales
representatives, four trainers, four service technicians, and some support staff.
After hearing of the excellent reputation of Kwantlen’s INFO students, Sheev and Mace have decided to hire you to
build the custom information system for their business.

In your first meeting, Mace provided an overview of the business’ processes and staff members. He identified the
managers within the company: Master Yoda is general manager and oversees all operations, Anakin Skywalker is the sales manager, Obi-Wan Kenobi is the training manager, and Padme Amidala is the service manager. Jango Fett is the office manager, managing the company’s business details. Jango’s employees include Commander Cody, who
looks after human resources, Captain Rex, who looks after payroll, and Sergeant Hunter, who looks after employee
benefits. Also working for Jango Fett is one IT administrator, named Tech Ninenine.

The sales department has six sales reps: Ahsoka Tano, Asajj Ventress, Bo-Katan Kryze, Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn,
and Grogu. The service department has four service technicians: General Grievous, Jar-Jar Binks, Artoo Detoo, and
See Threepio. The trainers are Ki-Adi Mundi, Dooku Serenno, Plo Koon, and Kit Fisto. The trainers have a
classroom that has ten networked computers for education and training. People coming in for training will be
assigned one of ten student accounts.
Each of the named people in the above section should have their own workstation, and of course their own user
account. The sales department has one printer. The service department has two pooled laser printers. One printer is
shared by everyone (trainers and students) in the training department. The company also has a workstation for the
company’s receptionist, who reports to Jango Fett (the receptionist uses a generic “Receptionist” account). Jango’s
administrative department has two pooled printers. Storage for the entire business should be provided using a NAS
or SAN system, but for the purposes of the project all shared folders will be stored on the main server.

Note that while Sheev and Mace own the business and are considered part of the organization, they do not work in
the business on a day-to-day basis, so they do not have user accounts or workstations in the system.
Internet access is via a broadband connection with a local Internet service provider. Guest WiFi is provided for
customer convenience, but this does not need to be implemented in your project.
